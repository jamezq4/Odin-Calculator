# Odin-Calculator
Calculator project from the Odin Project
This is my attempt at creating a calculator using html,css,and javascript,
The css part was a bit challenging as I struggled to get the calculator in the middle of the page,
but I realized i just had to change its position to remove it from the normal document flow
As for the javascript, it took me a while to figure out how to calculate two numbers at a time,
but i figured this out by using arrays to keep track of the numbers typed in and the numbers needed to calculate.
Chrome dev tools helped me through this a lot as well.
